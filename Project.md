# Project Question:
## Can we predict the District of Columbia's homicide rate for 2015 by looking at the homicide count of other cities and comparing them to this time in 2014?

### **What is the question you hope to answer?**
Nearing the end of August, Washington D.C.'s homicide count had already surpassed its record for 2014. Can we attribute this to specific local factors, or an unrest occurring nationally? 

### What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
 I will use data from police deparments of a small variety of highly populated cities, as well as census data targeting social factors such as average income by zip-code, concentration of post-high school degrees by area, and average age range per zip code.
 
### What do you know about the data so far? 

I knoe that Washington D.C. has already surpassed it's homicide count of 2014 for this year. I don't know much more beyond that.

### Why did you chose this topic?
I chose this topic because the rise in murders this year in D.C. has been alarming, but I recently discovered that D.C. isn't the only city to have surpassed their previous year's homicide count this year. I personally feel that the unrest going on in other parts of the country have been motivated by reasons such as polic brutality, or a poor local economy, but I don't see these issues to the same extreme in D.C. I want to find out if there is a built up anxiety in the U.S. that causes crime to occur in waves, if external factors are playing a part in the rise in murders in D.C. or if local events and occurences can be suggested at the reason for a rise in local crime.
